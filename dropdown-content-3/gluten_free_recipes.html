            <p style="color: rgb(211, 128, 68);"> This recipe is easily halved or multiplied, as needed. These are also excellent to use as sandwich bread, sloppy joe open-face bread, (better if you omit the sugar and use regular milk instead of buttermilk); strawberry shortcake, etc. Refrigerate any leftovers and warm about 15-20 seconds in microwave before filling with sandwich stuff.</p>

The Gluten-Free Rice Flour Mix for this recipe is made of 3 cups white rice flour, 3 cups brown rice flour, 2 cups potato starch (not flour) and 1 cup tapioca starch.
