From café classics like croissants and croque madames to the best of the brasseries, like French onion soup, boeuf bourguignon and ratatouille, these are some of the classic recipes you'll find in French homes and restaurants.</h3>

            <p style="color: rgb(211, 128, 68);">Properly cooking your onions (and using a ton of butter) is key to making this rich soup. The onions slowly caramelize, getting sweeter and sweeter, before you add the wine-and-brandy spiked broth. Toasted bread and gruyère are key if you want some epic cheese pulls.</p>

            <h1>Cherry Clafoutis</h1>

            <p style="color: rgb(211, 128, 68);">Think of this as the O.G. dump dessert. Clafoutis is a custardy skillet pie of sorts, dotted (traditionally) with cherries, but it's versatile enough to accommodate any of your favorite fruits.</p>

            <p style="color: rgb(211, 128, 68);">While it's undoubtedly one of the most iconic foods in France, the croissant is something even the most accomplished home bakers would prefer to buy at the boulangerie. But if you can't find a decent one at a bakery near you and you're feeling ambitious, check out these instructions for making the dough and laminating it to get that perfectly flaky texture. It's worth it!</p>
