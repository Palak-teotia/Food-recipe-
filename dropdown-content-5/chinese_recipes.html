            <p style="color: rgb(211, 128, 68);">I love this recipe and have been making these for a couple of years. An easy variation I have come up with is to use a purchased, fully-cooked rotisserie chicken, shred it, then toss it in teriyaki and garlic. Then add the bagged coleslaw mix and fold it all into wrappers. Delicious and time-saving!</p>
