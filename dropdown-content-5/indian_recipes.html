            <p style="color: rgb(211, 128, 68);">I've made this recipe several times now and I found this to be very true to the best restaurant version I've had. Paneer cubes are super easy to make, but Mexican queso blanco works very well, too.</p>

            <h1>BAKED POTATO SAMOSA</h1>
            <img src="dropdown_5_images/Baked_Potato_Samosa.jpg" alt="Baked Potato Samosa">
            <p style="color: rgb(211, 128, 68);">I really loved these samosas. Very easy. Not spicy, even with the jalape√±o it called for, but a great flavor with the spice combo. I ended up having to use pre-formed frozen pie crust, which I defrosted and pulled out of the pie plate. A quick swipe with the rolling pin and it worked perfectly. They were easy to fold up with egg wash on all of the sides.</p>

            <h1>ONION BHAJI</h1>
            <img src="dropdown_5_images/Onion_Bhaji.jpg" alt="Onion Bhaji">
            <p style="color: rgb(211, 128, 68);">These fried onion bites are a famous Indian snack, often used as a starter to the main meal. Easy to make and good to eat. An essential part of your curry.</p>
