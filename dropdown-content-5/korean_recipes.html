        <h1>Korean Recipes</h1>
        <h3>How do you sum up Korean cuisine? You could start with fermentation, and the health benefits it bestows on foods like kimchi and gochujang. You could touch on the wide variety of banchan (small side dishes) that are placed in the center of the table and shared at meals. Or you can focus on bulgogi and Korean BBQ, which have spread beyond borders to restaurants all over the world. It's healthy food with a focus on vegetables and big flavors, and here are some recipes to help you get started.</h3>

            <p style="color: rgb(211, 128, 68);">This, salty, spicy, funky ferment is one of the bases of Korean cuisine. Typically made with napa cabbage, white radishes and other vegetables, there are many different types that vary from north to south, and from family to family. It's normally served as banchan (a small side dish), but can also be cooked into dishes like kimchi-jjigae (kimchi stew).</p>

            <h1>Gimbap</h1>
            <img src="dropdown_5_images/Gimbap.jpg" alt="Gimbap">
            <p style="color: rgb(211, 128, 68);">Gimbap is, for all intents and purposes, the Korean descendant of Japanese makizushi, a holdover from the era of Japanese occupation. While Japanese makizushi is seasoned with rice vinegar, the rice in Korean gimbap is seasoned with sesame oil, and the center of the roll often contains multiple ingredientsâ€”from tuna to kimchi, and even deli meats and cheeses.</p>

            <p style="color: rgb(211, 128, 68);">These scallion pancakes are highly customizable. Swap the salmon for squid, clams, shrimp... whatever you'd like. Don't forget the spicy soy dipping sauce!</p>
